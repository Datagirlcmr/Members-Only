# Members Only (Ruby on Rails)

>  Building User Models, Post, and Comment models


In this project, we build an exclusive clubhouse application where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Built With

- Ruby language,
- Ruby on Rails framework,
- Vscode for coding
- Rubocop for Validation


## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
